! * The applied average is prescribed through the imoybr array:
!   - if imoybr(iusb(ii)) = 0 -> no average applied
!   - if imoybr(iusb(ii)) = 1 -> a time average is applied, i.e. the
!     statistic is divided by the last time step in the case of an unsteady
!     calculation with a number of iterations lower than nstbor; or that
!     the statistic is divided by the recording time in the case of a
!     steady calculation.
!    -if imoybr(iusb(ii)) = 2 -> a particle average is applied, i.e. the
!     statistic is divided by the number of recorded particle/boundary
!     interactions (in terms of statistical weight) in parbor(nfabor,inbr)
!     To use this average, inbrbd must be set to 1.
!   - if imoybr(iusb(ii)) = 3 -> (coal fouling only) a particle average
!     is applied, i.e. the statistic is divided by the number of recorded
!     particle/boundary interactions with fouling (in terms of statistical
!     weight) in parbor(nfabor,inbr), To use this average, iencnbbd must be
!     set to 1.
! * The back-ups in the restart file are performed without applying
!   this average.
! * The average is applied if the number of interactions (in statistical
!   weight) of the boundary face considered is greater than seuilf;
!   otherwise this average is set to zero.
