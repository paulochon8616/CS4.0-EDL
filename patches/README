Patches directory
=================

This directory contains files fixing potential problems that could arise
in some particular situations. These patches have not been fully validated
and therefore are NOT SUPPORTED.

* Particle tracking discards particles in case of warped faces
  ------------------------------------------------------------

The tracking algorithm assumes perfectly planar faces. A partial rewrite of
this algorithm, using new location tests, has been done for versions > 4.
The following patch provides this algorithm for version 4.0.

patch file : cs_lagr_tracking.c

To apply this patch, copy it to src/lagr in the source tree and reinstall,
or copy it to a user sources directory.

* Transient turbomachinery restart
  --------------------------------

For better transient turbomachinery restart behavior, the joined mesh is now
also handled using checkpoint/restart, starting from versions 4.3 and 4.2.1.
The following patch provides the algorithm for version 4.0:

patch file: turbomachinery_restart.patch

To apply this patch, run "patch -p0 < patches/turbomachinery_restart.patch"
in the top-level source directory, then reinstall the code.
